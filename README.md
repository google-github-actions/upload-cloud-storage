# upload-cloud-storage

This action uploads files/folders to a [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)][gcs] bucket. This is useful when
you want upload build artifacts from your workflow.

Paths to files that are successfully uploaded are set as output variables and can be
used in subsequent steps.

## Prerequisites

-   This action requires Google Cloud credentials that are authorized to upload
    blobs to the specified bucket. See the Authorization section below for more
    information.

-   This action runs using Node 16. If you are using self-hosted GitHub Actions
    runners, you must use runner version [2.285.0](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments)
    or newer.

## Usage

### For uploading a file

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - id: 'upload-file'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
      with:
        path: '/path/to/file'
        destination: 'bucket-name/file'

    # Example of using the output
    - id: 'uploaded-files'
      uses: 'foo/bar@main'
      env:
        file: '${{ steps.upload-file.outputs.uploaded }}'
```

The file will be uploaded to `gs://bucket-name/file`

### For uploading a folder

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - id: 'upload-folder'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
      with:
        path: '/path/to/folder'
        destination: 'bucket-name'

    # Example of using the output
    - id: 'uploaded-files'
      uses: 'foo/bar@main'
      env:
        files: '${{ steps.upload-folder.outputs.uploaded }}'
```

## Destination Filenames

If the folder has the following structure:

```text
.
└── myfolder
    ├── file1
    └── folder2
        └── file2.txt
```

### Default Configuration

With default configuration

```yaml
- id: 'upload-files'
  uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
  with:
    path: 'myfolder'
    destination: 'bucket-name'
```

The files will be uploaded to `gs://bucket-name/myfolder/file1`,`gs://bucket-name/myfolder/folder2/file2.txt`

Optionally, you can also specify a prefix in destination.

```yaml
- id: 'upload-files'
  uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
  with:
    path: 'myfolder'
    destination: 'bucket-name/myprefix'
```

The files will be uploaded to `gs://bucket-name/myprefix/myfolder/file1`,`gs://bucket-name/myprefix/myfolder/folder2/file2.txt`

### Upload to bucket root

To upload `myfolder` to the root of the bucket, you can set `parent` to false.
Setting `parent` to false will omit `path` when uploading to bucket.

```yaml
- id: 'upload-files'
  uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
  with:
    path: 'myfolder'
    destination: 'bucket-name'
    parent: false
```

The files will be uploaded to `gs://bucket-name/file1`,`gs://bucket-name/folder2/file2.txt`

If path was set to `myfolder/folder2`, the file will be uploaded to `gs://bucket-name/file2.txt`

Optionally, you can also specify a prefix in destination.

```yaml
- id: 'upload-files'
  uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
  with:
    path: 'myfolder'
    destination: 'bucket-name/myprefix'
    parent: false
```

The files will be uploaded to `gs://bucket-name/myprefix/file1`,`gs://bucket-name/myprefix/folder2/file2.txt`

### Glob Pattern

You can specify a glob pattern like

```yaml
- id: 'upload-files'
  uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
  with:
    path: 'myfolder'
    destination: 'bucket-name'
    glob: '**/*.txt'
```

This will particular pattern will match all text files within `myfolder`.

In this case, `myfolder/folder2/file2.txt` is the only matched file and will be uploaded to `gs://bucket-name/myfolder/folder2/file2.txt`.

If `parent` is set to `false`, it wil be uploaded to `gs://bucket-name/folder2/file2.txt`.

## Inputs

-   `path` - (Required) The path to a file or folder inside the action's
    filesystem that should be uploaded to the bucket.

    You can specify either the absolute path or the relative path from the
    action:

    ```yaml
    path: /path/to/file
    ```

    ```yaml
    path: ../path/to/file
    ```

-   `destination` - (Required) The destination for the file/folder in the form
    bucket-name or with an optional prefix in the form bucket-name/prefix

    ```yaml
    destination: bucket-name
    ```

    In the above example, the file will be uploaded to gs://bucket-name/file

    ```yaml
    destination: bucket-name/prefix
    ```

    In the above example, the file will be uploaded to
    gs://bucket-name/prefix/file

-   `gzip` - (Optional) Upload file(s) with gzip content encoding, defaults to
    true.

    ```yaml
    gzip: false
    ```

-   `resumable` - (Optional) Enable resumable uploads, defaults to true.

    ```yaml
    resumable: false
    ```

    In the above example, the file(s) will be uploaded without `gzip`
    content-encoding

-   `predefinedAcl` - (Optional) Apply a predefined set of access controls to
    the file(s).

    ```yaml
    predefinedAcl: projectPrivate
    ```

    In the above example, project team members get access to the uploaded
    file(s) according to their roles.

    Acceptable values are: `authenticatedRead`, `bucketOwnerFullControl`,
    `bucketOwnerRead`, `private`, `projectPrivate`, `publicRead`. See [the
    document](https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/storage/latest/global.html#UploadOptions)
    for details.

-   `headers` - (Optional) Set object metadata.

    ```yaml
    headers: |-
      content-type: application/json
      x-goog-meta-custom-field: custom-value
    ```

    In the above example, file `Content-Type` will be set to `application/json`
    and custom metadata with key `custom-field` and value `custom-value` will be
    added to it.

    Settable fields are: `Cache-Control`, `Content-Disposition`,
    `Content-Encoding`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Type`, `Custom-Time`. See
    [the
    document](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WorkingWithObjectMetadata#settable-fields;-field-values)
    for details.

    All custom metadata fields must be prefixed with `x-goog-meta-`.

-   `parent` - (Optional) Whether parent dir should be included in GCS
    destination, defaults to true.

    ```yaml
    parent: false
    ```

-   `glob` - (Optional) Glob pattern.

    ```yaml
    glob: '*.txt'
    ```

    defaults to 100.

    ```yaml
    concurrency: 10
    ```

-   `process_gcloudignore` - (Optional) Process a `.gcloudignore` file present
    in the top-level of the repository. If true, the file is parsed and any
    filepaths that match are not uploaded to the storage bucket. Defaults to
    true.

    ```yaml
    process_gcloudignore: true
    ```

-   `project_id` - (Optional) Google Cloud project ID to use for billing and API
    requests. By default, this is extracted from the credentials or the running
    environment.

    ```yaml
    project_id: 'my-project'
    ```

- `credentials`:  (**Deprecated**) This input is deprecated. See [auth
  section](#via-google-github-actionsauth) for more details. [Google Service
  Account JSON][sa] credentials as JSON or base64 encoded string, typically
  sourced from a [GitHub Secret][gh-secret]. If unspecified, other
  authentication methods are attempted. See [Authorization](#Authorization)
  below.

## Outputs

List of successfully uploaded file(s).

For example:

```yaml
- id: 'upload-file'
  uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
  with:
    path: '/path/to/file'
    destination: 'bucket-name/file'
```

will be available in future steps as the output "uploaded":

```yaml
- id: 'publish'
  uses: 'foo/bar@main'
  env:
    file: '${{ steps.upload-file.outputs.uploaded }}'
```

## Authorization

There are a few ways to authenticate this action. The caller must have
permissions to access the secrets being requested.

### Via google-github-actions/auth

Use [google-github-actions/auth](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth) to authenticate the action. You can use [Workload Identity Federation][wif] or traditional [Service Account Key JSON][sa] authentication by specifying the `credentials` input. This Action supports both the recommended [Workload Identity Federation][wif] based authentication and the traditional [Service Account Key JSON][sa] based auth.

See [usage](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#usage) for more details.

#### Authenticating via Workload Identity Federation

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
```

#### Authenticating via Service Account Key JSON

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0'
      with:
        credentials_json: '${{ secrets.gcp_credentials }}'

    - uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
```

### Via Application Default Credentials

If you are hosting your own runners, **and** those runners are on Google Cloud,
you can leverage the Application Default Credentials of the instance. This will
authenticate requests as the service account attached to the instance. **This
only works using a custom runner hosted on GCP.**

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    steps:
    - id: 'upload-file'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v0'
```

The action will automatically detect and use the Application Default
Credentials.
